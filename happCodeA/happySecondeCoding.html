    <p style="text-align: justify">
      I have been working as an BIM / Architectural technician for more than
      seven years.I have progressive experience in design, drawing, and
      presentation of concept projects and application projects. I worked on
      various types and scales of projects. Some examples I worked on are
      interior design projects, renovation projects, residential projects,
      school projects, public projects, commercial projects, and office
      projects. I am now very keen to gain more architectural experience.
